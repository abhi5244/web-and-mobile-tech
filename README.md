electricity calculator application

my app is used to caluculate how much electricity is consumed  in a house with the use of electrical appliances.

For initial purpose i have taken some appliances like refrigrators, ceiling fans, air conditioners, room heaters, flouresent lights, washing machines and ovens 

it is caluculated based on number of items and daily average hours used.
